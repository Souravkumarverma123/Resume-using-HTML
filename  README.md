- `<article>` – Individual projects
- `<table>` – Structured data (Experience & Education)
- `<footer>` – Copyright information

### Accessibility & Readability
- Proper heading hierarchy (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`)
- Screen-reader friendly structure
- Tables used only for tabular data
- Clear separation of content sections
